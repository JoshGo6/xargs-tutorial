In Linux, we commonly use pipes to chain the standard output of one command into the standard input of the next command, allowing for commands to run in sequence on the output of previous commands. Not all commands operate on standard input, however, and for these cases, we need to use `xargs` to act on standard input. This tutorial shows you how to use `xargs`.

> **IMPORTANT:** This tutorial is kept on my local computer in an Obsidian vault, which uses different linking syntax than GitHub does. Unfortunately, almost none of the linking in the tutorial operates on GitHub.

Without further ado, enjoy [learning about `xargs`](xargs-exec-and-piping.md)
